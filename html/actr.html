    <h2>ACT-R</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu">ACT-R</a> is a theoretical framework for building simulated cognitive agents. It includes a theory of long-term memory, speciically, the way in which items in memory are activated by stimuli and recalled. Furthermore, it includes a theory of decision-making based on the matching of production rules. ACT-R is written in Common Lisp and should compile and run on any Common Lisp implementation.

        My work with ACT-R primarily involved writing models that were intended to be integrated into a larger framework. In particular, I combined ACT-R with the <a href="https://grey.colorado.edu/CompCogNeuro/index.php/CCNBook/Main">Leabra</a> neural network framework to create a hybrid framework called SAL (Synthesis of ACT-R and Leabra). The idea was to leverage the different strengths of the two different cognitive architectures, with Leabra handling low-level functions like object recognition and ACT-R handling top-down directing of attention and memory recall. This work is described in several publications.
